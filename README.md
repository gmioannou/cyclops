The Cyprus Continuously Operating Natural Hazards Monitoring and Prevention System (RPF/INFRASTRUCTURES/1216/0050), abbreviated CyCLOPS, is co-financed by the European Union Regional Fund and the Republic of Cyprus through the Research Promotion Foundation. 

The main objective of the project is the establishment of a novel Strategic Research Infrastructure Unit for monitoring Solid Earth processes and Geohazards in Cyprus and the broader EMENA region. 

CyCLOPS has deployed permanent co-located multi-sensor configurations (Tier-1 GPS/GNSS reference stations, SAR Corner Reflectors, weather stations, tiltmeters et al) throughout Cyprus to promote geohazard monitoring, critical infrastructure resilience and enhance National Geodetic and Spatial Data Infrastructure.
